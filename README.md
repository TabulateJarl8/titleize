#TitleCase
----
TitleCase is a Python module to convert text to titlecase. Titlecase is the text format that is commonly used in titles. Example: `There Is a Bird Over There. He Is a Robin`

It may not look like much but there are specific rules to follow to make This format appealing to the himan eye, and I've compressed it down into a Python module.

# Usage:
Titlecase is extremely simple to use. Just pass your string to the function and its done! Example:

```python
import titlecase
print(titlecase("i like to look at birds. Birds are really cool animals."))
```

That would output

```
I Like to Look At Birds. Birds Are Really Cool Animals.
```

Pretty cool, right? What are you waiting for? Install it now with `pip install titlecase`
